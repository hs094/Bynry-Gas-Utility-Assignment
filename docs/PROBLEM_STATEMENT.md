# Gas Utility Customer Service System

## Background

company's current system is not able to handle the volume of requests, and customers are
experiencing long wait times and poor service.

## Project Overview

Develop a Django application to provide consumer services for gas utilities. The application
would allow customers to submit service requests online, track the status of their requests,
and view their account information.

The application would also provide customer support representatives with a tool to manage
requests and provide support to customers.

- Status of the request
- Date and time the request was submitted
